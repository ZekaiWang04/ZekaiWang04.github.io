            <h2>Indigenous People and Fishing</h2>
            <p>
              It is long konwn that California contains vast fishing resources. In the Central Valley region, for example, the Chinook Salmon population was flourishing due to its special hydrology. Upon their arrival, the Europeans marveled at the abundance and size of the salmon caught in the rivers. According to ecological estiamtes, at least millions of salmon salmon returned each year to spawn throughout this vast watershed. The Indigenous people of California had long relied on fishing, with some nothern and coastal groups (for example the Coast Salish peoples, some groups of which live in the Bay area) depending on fish as their main food source. Due to lack of archaelogical evidence, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of fish caught by Indigenous peoples and the impact of fishing on the salmon population. One estimate suggests that the indigenous people harvested around 8.5 million pounds of salmon annually. However, from European settler's accounts, it is clear that indigenous fishing practices did not prevent the salmon population from thriving.
            </p>
            <p>
              The image below shows the hydrology and salmon runs in the Central Valley region. The left side of the image shows historically there are multiple salmon runs throughout the year, providing a consistent food source for indigenous peoples. However, due to construction of dams, current day salmon runs are fairly limited compared to historical runs.

            </p>
            <p>
              The indigenous people of the pacific coast had developed sophisticated fishing techniques and unique cultures centered around salmon fishing. Fishing methods were adapted to local ecosystems and included hook-and-lines, fish weirs, nets, spears, and basket traps. Building on the special dependency to salmon, many indigenous groups developed a sacred relationship with the fish, viewing them as gift-bearing relatives and treating them with respect. The tribal tradition of relying on salmon is still practiced today, and many tribes hold the belief that they would cease to have the same identity without the salmon.

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, many tribes still heavily rely on fishing. A recent report on California tribes' fish usage that surveyed tens of tribes found that they currently use a variety of 60 species of fish, invertebrate, and plant. More than 60% of the surveyed responded that they consume fish at least once per day, yet the fish useage rate is likely suppressed compared to historical levels due to water quantity and quality issues. This pattern of later settlers disrupting indigenous cultures through changing the environment resembles the elimination of tule marsh in the Bay Area, which once served as a vital resource for bedding, weaving, and canoe construction for local tribes. As salmons and other fish become more vulnerable due to human activities in the Paciric Northwest, we should recognize that conservation efforts transcend mere environmental concerns and are important for preserving cultural heritage of indigenous peoples as well.

            <h2>Early Commercial Fishing Industry</h2>
            <p>
              After the arrival of European settlers, commercial fishing actually remained relatively minimal. However, in the late 18th century of early 19th century, America, English, Russian, French, and Spanish fur hunters began to realize the value in sea otter and other fur resources. After a voyage to China, where merchants pay high value for furs, the fur hunters began to expand their operations along the Pacific Coast. The California fur rush had a devestating impact on the sea otter population, which was hunted to near extinction by the end of the 19th century.

            </p>
            <p>
              With the onset of the Gold Rush in late 1840s, the commercial fishing industry began to develop in California. By 1850, the Chinook salmon from Central Valley had attracted attention of commercial fishers. The development of canning technology in addition provided a way for fishers to preserve their catch. In 1864, California's first salmon cannery was established along the Sacramento River, and soon California become the origin to large commercial fish canneries. By the 1870s, more than 25 canneries were operating in the Central Valley region. In the 1880s, around 10 million pounds of salmon were commercially harvested each year from the Sacramento-San Joaquin in-river fishery.

            <p>
              While salmon remained an imporant species for commercial fishing, other species were also becoming popular. Sturgeon were harvested in the Central Valley region, Striped Bass (not native to California) were introduced from the East Coast in 1879 and quickly became harvested, Shads, Anchovies, Catfish, Carp, and other species were also fished commercially. The latter half of 19th century saw a great expansion of commercial fishing industry in California.

            <h2>Decline</h2>
            <p>
              The commercial fishing boom since the 1860s and other human activities had a deep impact on the ecological system. In the Central Valley region, the Gold Rush triggered massive landscape disruption (including hydraulic mining and deforestation) polluted the rivers, and the indiscriminant overcatching of salmon make the srping and winter run samlon population start to decline rapidly. Coupled with habitat loss due to logging and urbanization, by 1920s several runs were nearly eliminated in the Central Valley region. Salmon hatcheries were established since the late 19th century (one of the first public fish hatcheries in California is the State Hatching House established in 1870 at UC Berkeley) in order to sustain commercial harvests and mitigate the declining natural population. However, as dam construction blocked access to as much as 75% of natural habitat, the salmon population remained very fragile.
