            <h2>Indigenous People and Fishing</h2>
            <p>
              It is long konwn that California contains vast fishing resources. In the Central Valley region, for example, the Chinook Salmon population was flourishing due to its special hydrology. Upon their arrival, the Europeans marveled at the abundance and size of the salmon caught in the rivers. According to ecological estiamtes, at least millions of salmon salmon returned each year to spawn throughout this vast watershed. The Indigenous people of California had long relied on fishing, with some nothern and coastal groups (for example the Coast Salish peoples, some groups of which live in the Bay area) depending on fish as their main food source. Due to lack of archaelogical evidence, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of fish caught by Indigenous peoples and the impact of fishing on the salmon population. One estimate suggests that the indigenous people harvested around 8.5 million pounds of salmon annually. However, from European settler's accounts, it is clear that indigenous fishing practices did not prevent the salmon population from thriving.

              The image below shows the hydrology and salmon runs in the Central Valley region. The left side of the image shows historically there are multiple salmon runs throughout the year, providing a consistent food source for indigenous peoples. However, due to construction of dams, current day salmon runs are fairly limited compared to historical runs.

              The indigenous people of the pacific coast had developed sophisticated fishing techniques and unique cultures centered around salmon fishing. Fishing methods were adapted to local ecosystems and included hook-and-lines, fish weirs, nets, spears, and basket traps. Building on the special dependency to salmon, many indigenous groups developed a sacred relationship with the fish, viewing them as gift-bearing relatives and treating them with respect. The tribal tradition of relying on salmon is still practiced today, and many tribes hold the belief that they would cease to have the same identity without the salmon.

            </p>
            <p>
              Today, many tribes still heavily rely on fishing. A recent report on California tribes' fish usage that surveyed tens of tribes found that they currently use a variety of 60 species of fish, invertebrate, and plant. More than 60% of the surveyed responded that they consume fish at least once per day, yet the fish useage rate is likely suppressed compared to historical levels due to water quantity and quality issues. As salmons and other fish become more vulnerable due to human activities in the Paciric Northwest, we should recognize that conservation efforts transcend mere environmental concerns and are important for preserving cultural heritage of indigenous peoples as well. This pattern of later settlers disrupting indigenous cultures through changing the environment resembles the elimination of tule marsh in the Bay Area, which once served as a vital resource for bedding, weaving, and canoe construction for local tribes.
