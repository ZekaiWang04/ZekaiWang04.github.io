            <h2>Indigenous People and Fishing</h2>
            <p>
              It is long konwn that California contains vast fishing resources. In the Central Valley region, for example, the chinook salmon population was flourishing due to its special hydrology. Upon their arrival, the Europeans marveled at the abundance and size of the salmon caught in the rivers. According to ecological estiamtes, at least millions of salmon salmon returned each year to spawn throughout this vast watershed. The Indigenous people of California had long relied on fishing, with some nothern and coastal groups (for example the Coast Salish peoples, some groups of which live in the Bay area) depending on fish as their main food source. Due to lack of archaelogical evidence, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of fish caught by Indigenous peoples and the impact of fishing on the salmon population. One estimate suggests that the indigenous people harvested around 8.5 million pounds of salmon annually. However, from European settler's accounts, it is clear that indigenous fishing practices did not prevent the salmon population from thriving.
            </p>
            <p>
              The image below shows the hydrology and salmon runs in the Central Valley region. The left side of the image shows historically there are multiple salmon runs throughout the year, providing a consistent food source for indigenous peoples. However, due to construction of dams, current day salmon runs are fairly limited compared to historical runs.

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              The indigenous people of the pacific coast had developed sophisticated fishing techniques and unique cultures centered around salmon fishing. Fishing methods were adapted to local ecosystems and included hook-and-lines, fish weirs, nets, spears, and basket traps. Building on the special dependency to salmon, many indigenous groups developed a sacred relationship with the fish, viewing them as gift-bearing relatives and treating them with respect. The tribal tradition of relying on salmon is still practiced today, and many tribes hold the belief that they would cease to have the same identity without the salmon. 
              <figure class="info-figure">

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, many tribes still heavily rely on fishing. A recent report on California tribes' fish usage that surveyed tens of tribes found that they currently use a variety of 60 species of fish, invertebrate, and plant. More than 60% of the surveyed responded that they consume fish at least once per day, yet the fish useage rate is likely suppressed compared to historical levels due to water quantity and quality issues. This pattern of later settlers disrupting indigenous cultures through changing the environment resembles the elimination of tule marsh in the Bay Area, which once served as a vital resource for bedding, weaving, and canoe construction for local tribes. As salmons and other fish become more vulnerable due to human activities in the Paciric Northwest, we should recognize that conservation efforts transcend mere environmental concerns and are important for preserving cultural heritage of indigenous peoples as well.

            <h2>Early Commercial Fishing Industry</h2>
            <p>
              After the arrival of European settlers, commercial fishing actually remained relatively minimal. However, in the late 18th century of early 19th century, America, English, Russian, French, and Spanish fur hunters began to realize the value in sea otter and other fur resources. After a voyage to China, where merchants pay high value for furs, the fur hunters began to expand their operations along the Pacific Coast. The California fur rush had a devestating impact on the sea otter population, which was hunted to near extinction by the end of the 19th century. 
              <figure class="info-figure">

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              With the onset of the Gold Rush in late 1840s, the commercial fishing industry began to develop in California. By 1850, the Chinook salmon from Central Valley had attracted attention of commercial fishers. The development of canning technology in addition provided a way for fishers to preserve their catch. In 1864, California's first salmon cannery was established along the Sacramento River, and soon California become the origin to large commercial fish canneries. By the 1870s, more than 25 canneries were operating in the Central Valley region, and most of the salmon harvest were supplied to the local canneries. In the 1880s, around 10 million pounds of salmon were commercially harvested each year from the Sacramento-San Joaquin in-river fishery.

            <p>
              While salmon remained an imporant species for commercial fishing, other species were also becoming popular. Sturgeon were harvested in the Central Valley region, Striped Bass (not native to California) were introduced from the East Coast in 1879 and quickly became harvested, Shads, Anchovies, Catfish, Carp, and other species were also fished commercially. The latter half of 19th century saw a great expansion of commercial fishing industry in California.

            <h2>Immigrants and the Fishing Industry</h2>
            <p>
              Immigrants played a crucial role in California's developing commercial fishing industry. It is believed that Chinese immigrants founded California's salt-water fishing industry in early 1850s. While the first fisher's immediate origins were not well documented, the group comprised of gold miners coming to California for the Gold Rush only to be disappointed by the Foerign Miners Tax Act, fishers who immigrated to California, and the released labor from the trans-continental railroad construction later in the 1870s. By 1880s, almost thirty fishing villages along the San Francisco Bay area were established, with an estimated Chinese fisherman population of 1,000-4,000. One major characteristic of the Chinese fishing community is that they live in segregated small fishing villages that they built themselves along the waterways, consisting of large, unpainted redwood cabins. The size of these fishing villages ranges from just a dozen fishermen to several hundreds of residents. While some Chinser fishermen brought their spouses and children to California, many came here alone and sent money back to their families in China (and their income, although not very good in the US, was very high compared to what they could earn in China). In addition to permanent villages, many Chinese fishermen also erected semi-permanent camps on islands.

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              There are four main areas where Chinese fishing villages were concentrated: the San Francisco Bay, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers, Monterey, and San Diego. Early fishermen did not have a specialization in what fish they catch. Later in the 19th century, however, the fishermen in the San Francisco Bay specializes in shrimps (Cargo Franciscorum and Cargo Vulgaris), those in Monterey focused on squid, those in San Diego on barracuda and then abalone, and those in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers on anything but salmon since salmon due to retaliation and hostility towards any chinese fisherman trying to fish salmon. Ironically, Chinese immigrants were the most important component of the salmon canning industry in the late 19th century, comprising 86% of the labor force in the canneries due to their willingness to work for lower wages and being more dependable employees. 
              <figure class="info-figure">

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, Chinese fishermen faced significant discrimination and were never allowed to do business in peace. In addition to the general anti-Chinese sentiment, as early as in 1860 the California State Legislature imposed a $4 monthly tax on all Chinese fishermen when they make $20-$30 per month only during peak season. Although the tax was repealed four years later, subsequent legislature still systematically discriminated against Chinese fishermen. Starting from 1880s, laws were passed to prohibit Chinese from engaging in any fishing business (held unconstitutional later in court), forbid shrimping during seasons when shrimp were abundant (supported in court), prohibit exporting dried shrimp to China (where 90% of the catch was usually sent), and forbiding the use of the Chinese bag net (favored by Chinese fishermen). Systematic discrimination was not confined in the fishing industry. In 1882, the famous/notorious Chinese Exclusion Act was passed by the US Congress, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers (the act was not repealed until 1943 when the US had become alley with China in World War II, but even afterwards only 105 immigration quota was assigned to China annually). 
              <figure class="info-figure">

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              In that period of time, Chinese fishermen were frequently accused of depleting the fish in California. However the accusations were largely used to justify discriminatory laws, and the concerns were often neglected after Chinse fishermen were driven out of the particular fishery. For example, when Chinese fishermen were allowed to use fyke nets on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers, they were accused of depleting the rivers, however when Chinese were not allowed but Caucasians were, there was little concern or legislature effort. The same pattern happened to abalone fishing, where the Chinese fishermen were accused of overfishing and devestating the abalone population, but after Chinese were driven out of abalone fishing around 1890 the business remained profitable for at least 12 more years, suggesting that overfishing was not solely caused by Chinese fishermen.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of hostile legislature, the unwillingness of younger generations to continue fishing, and competitions from other fishers, by the early 20th century the Chinese fishermen villages began to decline. Towards 1940s, most Chinese fishing centers had disappeared, and very few of the fishermen's offsprings continued the fishing business.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chinese were not the only immigrants involved in California's early fishing industry. In the 1880s, the Japanese government began to allow emigration, and many Japanese immigrants entered the fishing industry. Italian and Portugese immigrants played important roles in the development of the tuna fishing industry in the early 20th century in San Diego. Italians were also involved in the booming sardine and anchovy fishing industry in Monterey, which quickly became the most profitable fisheries in the region.

            <div class="kicker">Consequences of Overfishing</div>
            <h2>Decline in Fisheries</h2>
            <p>
              The commercial fishing boom since the 1860s and other human activities had a deep impact on the ecological system. In the Central Valley region, in addition to the obvious overfishing, the Gold Rush triggered massive landscape disruption (including hydraulic mining and deforestation) polluted the rivers, and the indiscriminant overcatching of salmon make the srping and winter run samlon population start to decline rapidly. Coupled with habitat loss due to logging and urbanization, by 1920s several runs were nearly eliminated in the Central Valley region. Salmon hatcheries were established since the late 19th century (one of the first public fish hatcheries in California is the State Hatching House established in 1870 at UC Berkeley) in order to sustain commercial harvests and mitigate the declining natural population. However, as dam construction blocked access to as much as 75% of natural habitat, the salmon population remained very fragile.
              <figure class="info-figure">
                <img src="static/salmon_catches.png" alt="Salmon Catches Over Time">
                <figcaption>Salmon Catches Over Time in Sacramento-San Joaquin River per Year per Season</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              The decline of the sardine fishing industry in Monterey serves as another example. Starting in 1903, the sardine fishing industry quickly grew to a massive scale, peaking at 1935-1940 with as much as 726,000 tons of sardine caught in the state in a single year and becoming a major California export. At this time, sardines comprised the largest single-species fishery in the Western Hemisphere. Although scientists started to express concern about unsustainable levels of fishing as early as the 1930s, the government and the industry were reluctant to impose restrictions, citing the enormous economic benefits of the booming industry. However, due to a combination of overfishing, environmental, and climate factors (e.g. shifts in sea surface temperature and upwelling patterns, although research suggests that natural factors alone could not have resulted in such a large scale decline), the annual harvest plummeted to less than 100,000 tons by the early 1950s. Only then did policy makers begin to impose fishing restrictions (e.g. harvest quotas, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions), but by the time the policies were implemented the sardine population had already collapsed. In the 1960s, the once booming canneries in Monterey had to shut down. Monterey had since transformed from a fishing hub to a tourist attraction, with the famous Cannery Row being converted into shops and restaurants, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium being built on the site of an old sardine cannery. Other species such as abalone also suffered from overfishing during this period, with abalone's commercial harvest completely halting by 1997 due to population collapse.

            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            <p>
              In 1986, after a 18 year moratorium, California resumed sardine fishing and limited fishery to 907 tones annually. In 1999, the sardine population was declared fully recovered with an estimated biomass of over 1 million tons. Since then, a federal Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan has been established to provide a harvest guideline for sardine based on biomass estimates. From the figure below we can see that the landings have gradually increased and steadied until 2008, when fishers diverted their interest in squid fishing. As of 2011, squid has become the largest commercial fishery in California by weight and by value, followed by sardine, dungeness crab, sea urchin, and shrimp (by weight).

              Unfortunately, despite numerous conservation efforts, the chinook salmon population in the Central Valley region remains low, with escapements crashed to a historic low in 2009. Recently, 2022 saw the second lowest salmon return in history, suggesting the salmon population in the Central Valley has a long way to go before recovery. Dam construction, diversions of river water (e.g. the California Water Project), ocean conditions,  and climate change. Many plans to save the salmon population have been proposed and initiated, but it remains to be seen whether the efforts will be successful.
